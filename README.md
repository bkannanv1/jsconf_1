# Thinking and Coding in Algorithms

## Plan first and then code, that’s why ‘thinking’.

## Recommended Books

### Distilled

- ‘Discrete Math’ - Logic of how numbers work
- Take courses in Khan academy

### Unleashed

- Everything except DSA.

### About Course:

- Full course on fronend masters.
- Lean into absctraction by JS.
  - Don't write c in javascript.
- Learning implementation details.
  - Not a good computer scientist.
  - Don't code specific to implementat ion details.

### TL:DW

Developer - Solve problem and then understand it.
Engineer - Understand and then solve it.

Don't force a DS to solve a problem.
Find a suitable DS to solve problem.

Donald Knuth - Premature optimization.

It's not premature optimization that is all evil. It's immature optimization that is all evil - Kyle.

On critical path - Optimization is more important.
